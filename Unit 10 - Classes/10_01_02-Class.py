"""
A class is a template for a data type. It describes the kinds of information that class will hold and how a
programmer will interact with that data. Define a class using the class keyword. PEP 8 Style Guide for Python Code
recommends capitalizing the names of classes to make them easier to identify.

class CoolClass:
  pass

In the above example we created a class and named it CoolClass. We used the pass keyword in Python to indicate that
the body of the class was intentionally left blank so we don't cause an IndentationError. We'll learn about all the
things we can put in the body of a class in the next few exercises.

class Facade:
