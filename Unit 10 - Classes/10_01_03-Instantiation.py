"""A class doesn't accomplish anything simply by being defined. A class must be instantiated. In other words,
we must create an instance of the class, in order to breathe life into the schematic.

Instantiating a class looks like calling a function. We can create an instance of our defined CoolClass as follows:

cool_instance = CoolClass()

Above, we created an object by adding parentheses to the name of the class. We then assigned that new instance to the
variable cool_instance for safe-keeping so we can access our instance of CoolClass at a later time.
