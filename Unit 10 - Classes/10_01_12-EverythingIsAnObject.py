"""
Attributes can be added to user-defined objects after instantiation, so it’s possible for an object to have some
attributes that are not explicitly defined in an object’s constructor. We can use the dir() function to investigate
an object’s attributes at runtime. dir() is short for directory and offers an organized presentation of object
attributes.

class FakeDict:
  pass

fake_dict = FakeDict()
fake_dict.attribute = "Cool"

dir(fake_dict)
# Prints ['__class__', '__delattr__', '__dict__', '__dir__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__format__', '__ge__',
          '__getattribute__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__init__()', '__init_subclass__', '__le__', '__lt__',
          '__module__', '__ne__', '__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__setattr__', '__sizeof__',
          '__str__', '__subclasshook__', '__weakref__', 'attribute']

That’s certainly a lot more attributes than we defined! Python automatically adds a number of attributes to all
objects that get created. These internal attributes are usually indicated by double-underscores. But sure enough,
attribute is in that list.

Do you remember being able to use type() on Python’s native data types? This is because they are also objects in
Python. Their classes are int, float, str, list, and dict. These Python classes have special syntax for their
instantiation, 1, 1.0, "hello", [], and {} specifically. But these instances are still full-blown objects to Python.

fun_list = [10, "string", {'abc': True}]

type(fun_list)
# Prints <class 'list'>

dir(fun_list)
# Prints ['__add__', '__class__', [...], 'append', 'clear', 'copy', 'count', 'extend', 'index', 'insert', 'pop',
          'remove', 'reverse', 'sort']

Above we define a new list. We check it’s type and see that’s an instantiation of class list. We use dir() to explore
its attributes, and it gives us a large number of internal Python dunder attributes, but, afterward, we get the usual
list methods.
