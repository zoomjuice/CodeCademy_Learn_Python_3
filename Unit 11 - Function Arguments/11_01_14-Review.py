We covered a lot of ground in this lesson! We learned all about how functions can accept different arguments and
different styles by which we can pass those arguments in. We covered:

    The default return of a function: None
    How to create default arguments to a function
    How to make sure our default arguments work the way we expect when dealing with lists.
    How to pass keyword arguments to a function
    How to unpack multiple returns from a function
    How to unpack multiple positional arguments to a function
    How to unpack multiple keyword arguments to a function
    How to pass a list as a series of arguments to a function
    How to pass a dictionary as a series of keyword arguments to a function

This is a lot, and you should be impressed with yourself! You now should be able to read many different styles of
function writing in Python and come up with ways to call those functions with style and clarity.

Hopefully this has helped you as a writer of Python functions and enabled you to overcome any problems with input and
output of a Python function you might run into. Congrats!
