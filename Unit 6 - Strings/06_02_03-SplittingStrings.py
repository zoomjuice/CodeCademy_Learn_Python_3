"""
.split() is performed on a string, takes one argument, and returns a list of substrings found between the given
 argument (which in the case of .split() is known as the delimiter). The following syntax should be used:

string_name.split(delimiter)  # Note: $delimiter can be any string

If you do not provide an argument for .split() it will default to splitting at spaces.

For example, consider the following strings:

man_its_a_hot_one = "Like seven inches from the midday sun"
print(man_its_a_hot_one.split())
# => ['Like', 'seven', 'inches', 'from', 'the', 'midday', 'sun']

.split returned a list with each word in the string. Important to note: if we run .split() on a string with no spaces,
 we will get the same string in return.

When you split a string on a character that it ends with, youâ€™ll end up with an empty string at the end of the list.

print(greatest_guitarist.split('a'))
# => ['s', 'nt', 'n', ' ']

We can also split strings using escape sequences like \n or \t.
