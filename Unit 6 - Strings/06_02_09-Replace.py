"""
The next string method we will cover is .replace(). Replace takes two arguments and replaces all instances of the first
 argument in a string with the second argument. The syntax is as follows

string_name.replace(old_string, new_string)

Great! Letâ€™s put it in context and look at an example.

with_spaces = "You got the kind of loving that can be so smooth"
with_underscores = with_spaces.replace(' ', '_')
print(with_underscores)
# 'You_got_the_kind_of_loving_that_can_be_so_smooth'

Here we used .replace() to change every instance of a space in the string above to be an underscore instead.
