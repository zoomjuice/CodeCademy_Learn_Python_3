"""
A dictionary is an unordered set of key: value pairs.

It provides us with a way to map pieces of data to each other so that we can quickly find values that are associated
 with one another.

Suppose we want to store the prices of various items sold at a cafe:

    Avocado Toast is 6 dollars
    Carrot Juice is 5 dollars
    Blueberry Muffin is 2 dollars

In Python, we can create a dictionary called menu to store this data:

menu = {"avocado toast": 6, "carrot juice": 5, "blueberry muffin": 2}

Notice that:

    A dictionary begins and ends with curly braces { and }.
    Each item consists of a key ("avocado toast") and a value (6).
    Each key: value pair is separated by a comma.

Itâ€™s considered good practice to insert a space () after each comma, but our code will still run without the space.
